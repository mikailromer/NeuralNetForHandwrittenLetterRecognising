# NeuralNetForHandwrittenLetterRecognising
Repository contains Python source code, which initialize Convolution Neural Network, used for recognition of images, presenting handwritten letters.
First of all, program loads samples of images from emnist-letters.mat file and prepares it for learning process. Secoundly, program sets up an architecture of Neural Net and trains the CNN model, which is saved in the file, located in models directory.
At the end, program loads a CNN model, from  file, loacated in models directory and perform validation process of the CNN model.
